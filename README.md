# FDBN_Learning

This repository contains the packages and scripts used in our federated learning implementation of the DBN (Dynamic Bayesian Network) methodology.

## package

1. **`Mat.sim`**: Simulates the matrices \( W \) and \( A \), which represent the relationships in the dynamic Bayesian network.
2. **`Data.sim`**: Generates simulated data, including the lagged versions of the data used in the model.
3. **`Metric`**: Provides tools for evaluating model performance using relevant metrics.

## Demo

The `demos` directory includes an example implementation of our \texttt{2DBN} method, demonstrating how to use the packages and apply the methodology.
