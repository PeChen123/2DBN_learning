# **FDBN_Learning**  

This repository contains the packages and scripts used in our federated learning implementation of the DBN (Dynamic Bayesian Network) methodology.  

## **Package Overview**  

1. **`Mat.sim`**: Simulates the matrices \( W \) and \( A \), which represent the relationships in the dynamic Bayesian network.  
2. **`Data.sim`**: Generates simulated data, including the lagged versions of the data used in the model.  
3. **`Metric`**: Provides tools for evaluating model performance using relevant metrics (SHD, TPR, FDR).  
4. **`FDBNL`**: A package for Federated Dynamic Bayesian Network Learning.  
5. **`PFDBNL`**: A package for Personalized Federated Dynamic Bayesian Network Learning.  

## **Demos**  

The `demos` directory includes example implementations of our `FDBNL` and `PFDBNL` methods, demonstrating how to use the packages and apply the methodology.  

## **Real-World Data**  

This directory contains the real-world data used in our applications. We provide an example for mFRI to illustrate how to use our package. Similar code can be applied to Dream4 as well.
